## Overview

This project aims to simplify development process of Odoo addons as much as possible.

odoo-helper-scripts will do all routine operations for you:
- install odoo with ALL dependencies (even those not mentioned in odoo's requirements.txt like [python-slugify](https://pypi.org/project/python-slugify/))
- manage local development databases
- install custom addons
- check if versions of modules are updated before pushing changes.
- generate / regenerate translations
- run tests
- and a lot more

If you have any routine operation that you would like to automate with odoo-helper-scripts,
just fill an issue or do pull request, and may be that feature will be available in one of next releases.

***WARNING***: If you want to deploy production-ready odoo server,
please, read carefully [Usage notes](#usage-note) section.

## Features

- Easily manage multiple instances of Odoo that ran on same machine
- Wide usage of [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) for isolation purpose

- The easiest way to install Odoo for development purposes (but not limited to development)
    - single command to install odoo
    - ability to build custom python for odoo
- Powerful testing capabilities, including support for:

    - simplify forward-port process (move changes from older serie to newer (for example from 11.0 to 12.0))
- Translation management from command line
    - import / export translations by command from shell
    - test translation rate for specified language
    - regenerate translations for specified language

    - Also should work on *Debian* based systems, but some troubles may happen with installation of system dependencies.
    - Other linux systems - in most cases should work, but system dependecies must be installed manualy.

## Documentation

***Note*** Documentaion in this readme, or in other sources, may not be up to date!!!
So use ``--help`` option, which is available for most of commands.

## Usage note

This script collection is designed to simplify life of addons developer.
This project ***is not designed, to install and configure production ready Odoo instances***, unless you know what you do!

For **production-ready** installations take a look at [crnd-deploy](http://github.com/crnd-inc/crnd-deploy) project - just a single command allows you to get production-ready odoo instance with configured [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Nginx](https://nginx.org/).

Also take a look at [Yodoo Cockpit](https://crnd.pro/yodoo-cockpit) project, and discover the easiest way to manage your production Odoo installations with automated billing and support of custom addons.

[![Yodoo Cockpit](https://crnd.pro/web/image/18846/banner_2_4_gif_animation_cut.gif)](https://crnd.pro/yodoo-cockpit)

Just short notes about [Yodoo Cockpit](https://crnd.pro/yodoo-cockpit):
- start new production-ready odoo instance in 1-2 minutes.
- add custom addons to your odoo instances in 5-10 minutes.
- out-of-the-box email configuration: just press button and add some records to your DNS, and get a working email
- make your odoo instance available to external world (internet) in 30 seconds (just add single record in your DNS)

## Installation

For full list of installation options look at [installation documentation](https://katyukha.gitlab.io/odoo-helper-scripts/installation/)

Basically, odoo-helper could be installed in two way:
- Traditional installation via shell script
- Installation via deb package (still experimental)

### Traditional installation

To install *odoo-helper-scripts* system-wide (the recommended way) do folowing:

```bash
# Install odoo-helper-scripts
wget -O - https://gitlab.com/katyukha/odoo-helper-scripts/raw/master/install-system.bash | sudo bash -s

# Install system dependencies required for odoo-helper-scripts
# NOTE: Works only on debian-based systems
odoo-helper install pre-requirements
```

or more explicit way:

```bash
# Download installation script
wget -O /tmp/odoo-helper-install.bash https://gitlab.com/katyukha/odoo-helper-scripts/raw/master/install-system.bash;

# Install odoo-helper-scripts
sudo bash /tmp/odoo-helper-install.bash;

#  Intall system pre-requirements for odoo-helper-scripts
# NOTE: Works only on debian-based systems
odoo-helper install pre-requirements
```

### Installation as deb package

Also, you can install *odoo-helper-scripts* as debian package. See [releases](https://gitlab.com/katyukha/odoo-helper-scripts/-/releases) page.
To install the latest **stable** version just download and install following deb package: [odoo-helper-scripts_master.deb](https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/6823247/packages/generic/odoo-helper-scripts/master/odoo-helper-scripts_master.deb)


## Test your OS support

It is possible to run basic tests via docker.
For this task, odoo-helper-scripts repo contains script `scripts/run_docker_test.bash`.
Run `bash scripts/run_docker_test.bash --help` to see all available options for that script.

For example to test, how odoo-helper-scripts will work on debian:stretch, do following:

```bash
cd $ODOO_HELPER_ROOT
bash scripts/run_docker_test.bash --docker-ti --docker-image debian:stretch
```

Note, running tests may take more then 1:30 hours.


## Usage

And after install you will have available folowing scripts in your path:

- odoo-install
- odoo-helper

Each script have `-h` or `--help` option which display most relevant information
about script and all possible options and subcommands of script

Also there are some aliases for common commands:

- odoo-helper-addons
- odoo-helper-db
- odoo-helper-fetch
- odoo-helper-log
- odoo-helper-restart
- odoo-helper-server
- odoo-helper-test

For more info look at [documentation](https://katyukha.gitlab.io/odoo-helper-scripts/). (currently documentation status is *work-in-progress*).
Also look at [Frequently used commands](https://katyukha.gitlab.io/odoo-helper-scripts/frequently-used-commands/) and [Command reference](https://katyukha.gitlab.io/odoo-helper-scripts/command-reference/)

Also look at [odoo-helper-scripts tests](./tests/test.bash) to get complete usage example (look for *Start test* comment).
